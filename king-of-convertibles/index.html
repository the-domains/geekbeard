<h1>King of convertibles?</h1><h2>Watch out Surface Pro and iPad Pro. Huawei's Matebook may just be the best convertible yet</h2><p>Tablet PCs are increasingly popular among business people who like to stay productive while they’re on the move.</p><p>They love the light weight, long battery life and portability of slates like Apple’s iPads and high-end equivalents running Google’s Android operating system.</p><p>But many find themselves going back to lugging around heavier, bulkier and more power hungry laptops. Why?
The trouble with nearly all tablets is that they’re actually not very good for doing serious work on.</p><p>Briefly replying to an email by jabbing away at the virtual keyboard on the touchscreen isn’t too painful, but anything longer is a real chore.
Yes, you can use a wireless keyboard, but most are pretty substandard and the Bluetooth connection can be finicky.</p><p>Then there’s the operating system used by most tablets – iOS or Android. Both are designed for mobile devices with smallish screens and can be pretty frustrating for anyone used to multitasking with several windows open at the same time.</p><blockquote><p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could combine all the benefits of a lightweight tablet with the power of a high-end laptop?
</p></blockquote><p>Enter the convertible. No, not a car with a retractable roof, but something a lot more practical.</p><p>Convertibles, as the name suggests, are tablets that convert almost instantly into svelte, but near-full-featured notebook PCs.</p><p>They’re one of the fastest growing categories in the business technology space.
Apple’s iPad Pro and Microsoft’s Surface Pro are the best known of the convertibles, but there’s a new kid on the block and it’s as good, if not better in several respects.</p><h2>New kid on the block</h2><picture>

<p>It’s the Huawei Matebook and I was lucky enough to attend its unveiling at the recent Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the world’s biggest mobile technology expo.</p><p>The MateBook runs on Windows 10, so it’ll be instantly familiar to anyone used to this operating system.</p><p>And unlike most tablets – and many laptops – it’s got enough processing power lurking under its sleek aluminium and glass exterior to please even the fussiest power user. </p><p>It’s powered by a 6th Generation Intel Core m-series processor, putting high-speed processing oomph and the most essential business productivity tools, including Microsoft Office, at your fingertips.</p><p>The device offers up to 8GB of LPDDR3 memory and a solid-state hard drive with capacity of up to 512GB. Somehow Huawei’s managed cram of this into the Matebook while still ensuring it runs cool enough not to need a fan – so there’ll be no distracting whirr while you’re pondering the finer points of your PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>It’s also great to look at, no small consideration for a device you’ll probably be staring at for several hundred hours each year.</p><p>The strong, high quality aluminium unibody has minimal embellishments and almost non-existent bezels, so there’s little to distract you from its star attraction, the 12-inch IPS multi-touch screen with a resolution of 2160x1440 and a 160-degree wide angle for a surprisingly immersive experience.</p><p>And weighing in at a mere 640g, it truly is take-nearly-anywhere device. Cleverly, the combined power supply and charger cable is not much bigger than your average smartphone charger and it has a nice long cable for those all too common occasions when the nearest plug point is in a hard-to-reach spot.
</p><p>The optional wraparound keyboard case is one of the better examples I’ve encountered, with nice big chiclet-style keys and a decent amount of key travel. It doesn’t feel quite like full-size keyboard, but it comes pretty close.</p><p>It’s made of PU leather – a combination of leather and synthetic materials – and is mildly water resistant so you won’t need to fear dashing through an unexpected rain shower with it to catch a cab.</p><p>Another nifty accessory is the stylus, useful if you taking notes the old fashioned way, sign a lot of electronic documents or just like to doodle in meetings. It also doubles as a laser pointer for delivering presentations. I’m amazed no one’s thought of this before.</p><picture>

<p>Security is another important consideration for business people and the Matebook takes this to the next level with what Huawei claims is the world’s first one-touch unlock fingerprint reader for a tablet.</p><p>Of course, all the features in the world are worth little if your device runs out of power after just a couple of hours. You have no worries on this score with the Matebook.  Huawei claims its 33.7Wh high-density lithium battery will deliver enough juice for nine hours of work, nine consecutive hours of Internet use and 29 hours of music playback.</p><p>The battery also reaches a full charge in just two-and-a-half hours and when there isn’t enough time for a full charge, the device can power up to 60 percent battery strength in just one hour.</p><p>“With this landmark device, Huawei is demonstrating our industry-leading design and manufacturing expertise by bringing a beautifully crafted flagship product to market that is redefining the new style of business – connected computing across all devices in almost every scenario,” Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei’s Consumer Business Group told journalists at the launch.</p><p>“Huawei has successfully channeled its comprehensive experience and excellence in building premium mobile products into the needs of the modern business environment by introducing a highly efficient device, seamlessly capable of integrating work and entertainment functions.” 
</p><p>Alas, all this power and portability doesn’t come cheap. Huawei hasn’t announced when the Matebook will be available in South Africa, nor at what price, but the US dollar prices will give you some idea of what to expect when its lands here.
It starts at $699 (R10 560) for the version with 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage and climbs to $1,599 (R24 165) for the top of the range model with 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage.</p><p>And that’s without any accessories. The cover/keyboard will set you back $129 (R1950) and the stylus $59 (R890).
Here’s hoping the rand doesn’t take another tumble.</p><p><i>A version of this article first appeared in the Sunday Tribune's Business KZN supplement on 28 February 2016.
