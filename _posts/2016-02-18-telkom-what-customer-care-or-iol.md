description: "If you have ever found yourself trapped in that circle of hell called Telkom customer service, you'll sympathise with the fellow customer who's started an online petition titled \"TELKOM! Get a proper customer care department\". Posted at Change.org, the motivation urging other Telkom users to sign the petition details a litany of woes."

A few weeks back [I reported on][0] how longstanding frustrations over Telkom's poor customer care had culminated in an [online petition][1] aimed at getting the communications parastatal to sort out the mess once and for all.

Predictably, many readers contacted me with their own complaints, but there were also a few who complimented Telkom for its speedy resolution of their problems.

Here's an excerpt from one of them...

> Last week my modem was hit by lightning and I took it to Telkom, Musgrave Centre. The gentleman there, Dennis, was very helpful... the whole experience was a pleasure - Cynthia, happy Telkom customer

Still, the feedback was overwhelmingly negative and Telkom has a real mountain to climb in getting all its disparate legacy customer-facing systems consolidated into a unified, effective customer care system.

As I pointed out in [the articl][2]e, Telkom is aware of the issue and working to solve it. I've since been informed that a big announcement regarding this is in the offing.

Watch this space, but don't hold your breath either.
