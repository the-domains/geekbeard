description: "A restored HD version of the original Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope 35mm print has appeared online. While this isn't the first time that attempts have been made to restore Star Wars to its original theatrical version-that's the one without the much-maligned CGI effects and edits of later \"special\" editions-it is the first to have been based entirely on a single 35mm print of the film, rather than cut together from various sources."

# By George, Han DID shoot first

If there's still anyone you know who believes the alien thug Greedo fired first in the original (subsequently sanatised) version of the cantina scene of Star Wars Episode IV, point them to this recently surfaced version of the movie.

Another reason to seek out this lovingly restored HD version of A New Hope is the complete absence of crappy CGI added in later versions...
