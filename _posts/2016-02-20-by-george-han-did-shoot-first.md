# By George, Han DID shoot first

If there's still anyone you know who believes the alien thug Greedo fired first in the original (subsequently sanatised) version of the cantina scene of Star Wars Episode IV, point them to this recently surfaced version of the movie.

Another reason to seek out this lovingly restored HD version of A New Hope is the complete absence of crappy CGI added in later versions...
