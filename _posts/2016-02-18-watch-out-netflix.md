# Watch out, Netflix

## ...or maybe not just yet

Google's quietly launched its Play Movies service in South Africa.

As this article reveals, you can hire movies starting at just R11,99 for older titles and R34,99 for the latest blockbusters. Outright purchases of the latest titles will cost R149,99\.

But - and it's a big but - there's no TV series yet, nor any indication when there will be.
