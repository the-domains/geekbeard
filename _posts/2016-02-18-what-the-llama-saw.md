# What the llama saw

As the world's tech journalists champ at the bit to get their hands on Samsung's new Galaxy S7 at it's official unveiling on Sunday, it seems they've been beaten to the punch - and by a Llama, nogal.

No, not the Dalai Lama. I'm talking about the wooly, long-necked mammal beloved of sweater makers and cartoonists - although this tale is surreal enough to have inspired a painting by that other famous Dali, Salvador.

Its also a great piece of humerous writing from gearburn.com's clever Andy Walker.
