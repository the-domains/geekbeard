# S7th heaven

Samsung's just launched its new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

Although details of the devices were widely leaked ahead of the official unveiling by the company's Mobile chief DJ Koh, they didn't do justice to just how great the two flagship projects look and feel in the flesh - or should that be glass and steel?

While at first glance they look quite a bit like their predecessors, there are actually quite a few differences, some subtle and some quite significant.

First the biggies...

One of the big disappointments of the S6 line was that Samsung did away with the removable battery, water resistance and the micro SD card slot.

## Beefier batteries

There's still no removable battery - nor is there likely to ever again be one given how these devices are now crafted. But Samsung's done the next best (for traditionalists) thing by squeezing in bigger batteries.

The S7 comes with a 3000 mAh battery, up from the S6's 2550 mAh, while the S7 Edge boast a beefy 3600 mAh battery, a full 1000 mAh bigger than the S6 Edge. 

There's also a range of aftermarket battery packs and wireless charging attachments available. 

## Thanks for the memory

The micro SD card makes a welcome return, and as [Ars Technica points out][0],  both devices will ship with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which allows users to merge the SD card with the internal flash memory to create one large seamless pool of storage.

# Make a splash

One of the things I really liked about the Galaxy S5 was its water resistance. Although it's ingress protection level of IP67 meant it was only guaranteed to protect you from temporary immersion, it was enough to save the phone from a temporary dunking like a drop in the loo or a poolside fumble.

I wasn't alone in my disappointment when Samsung removed even this mild level of protection with the S6 line. But now it's back and better than ever.

With an IP68 rating, the S7 and S7 Edge are now both totally dust tight and will withstand submersion in a meter and a half of water for 30 minutes. Nicely played, Samsung!

The company's clearly listened to it's customers, a point underlined by Koh at the launch.

"We listen to our customers and... never assume we know everything. Unlike some companies, we would never presume to tell our customers what they should want," he said.

No prizes for guessing who he's talking about.

## Fewer, but bigger pixels

Speaking of Apple-bashing, the camera on the S7 and S7 Edge was repeatedly compared to the snapper on the iPhone 6 and not to Apple's benefit.

Although the megapixel count has dropped from 16MP to 12MP, Samsung's billing this as an upgrade because they've upped the pixel size, allowing more light into each snap.

The low-light examples shown at the launch looked particularly impressive and the few shots I snapped using the demo units on show bore this out.

There will also be some pretty nifty aftermarket accessories for the  S7 and S7 Edge, including some pretty nifty clip-on lenses.
