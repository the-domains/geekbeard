# Who'll reign in Spain?

Mobile World Congress in Barcelona is the world's biggest trade show devoted exclusively to mobile tech and this year Geekbeard will be there!

Nearly all of the big phone makers announce flagship devices at MWC and this year looks to be no exception judging by what I've heard.

These excellent articles from  [Engadget][0] and [Androidpit][1] sum it all up nicely.

I'm particularly looking forward to what Samsung, my hosts for the event, have in the offing. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge promise to rectify some of the shortcomings with its beautiful, but ever-so-slightly flawed, S6 line, including lack of expandable memory and water resistance.

I'm also dead keen to see what Huawei is going to unveil - holding thumbs that it'll be the eagerly awaited P9!
