# Internet of Things

## Why all the fuss suddenly?

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a trendy buzz phrase, but it actually describes something that's been around for a while: gadgets connected to their owners and each other over the Internet.

Internet-connected PCs were the original mass market IoT devices and they've existed in one form or another for more than 20 years.
Today most of us carry an IoT device around with us everywhere we go in the form of a smartphone.

If you have a Web-connected printer or security camera in your home or office, you're further enmeshed in the Internet of Things.

The reason IoT is such a hot trend at the moment is that the technology behind it has advanced to a stage where it's small and cheap enough to put into almost any gizmo you can think of: a fridge, toaster, wristwatch, ring or, even, a kid's toy.

Nowhere was this more evident than at Mobile World Congress (MWC) held in Barcelona recently. The IoT was everywhere you turned at this, the world's biggest annual trade show devoted to mobile technology.

While there were plenty of consumer gadgets like smart watches, fitness trackers and pet monitors on display, there were as many, if nor more, IoT devices and services aimed at businesses, or a combination of businesses and consumers.

Take Samsung's Family Hub smart fridge. The first thing you notice about it is the oversized tablet PC built into the door.

From this you can browse the web for a recipe, check your email and all the other things you can do with a conventional tablet.

But this slate also serves as a place to display digital version of photos, school timetables and shopping lists - the kind of stuff you find attached by magnets or post-it notes to old fashioned, 'dumb' fridges.

More interesting for businesses, you can keep track of what's in the fridge and - thanks to a partnership with MasterCard - order groceries using an app. You don't even have to be at home to do this because Web-linked cameras inside the fridge let you see exactly what's inside using your smartphone.

Don't expect too many of these pricey appliances to end up in South African homes any time soon, but think of the applications of this technology for inventory monitoring and similar uses.

Before too long a business owner won't need expensive, specialised gear to take advantage of these advances.
Dozens, even hundreds, of tiny IoT sensors can be attached to existing equipment to monitor temperature, vibration and other key indicators to warn of impending problems.

A refrigerated delivery van would be able to alert its owner to a sudden rise in temperature. A store room could warn bean counters when its door is opened when it shouldn't be. A machine in a factory could warn engineers that a key component is playing up, preventing a costly, potentially dangerous, breakdown - the digital age equivalent of a stitch in time.

Farming is another endeavour ripe for disruption using IoT technology.
At MWC a company called MyOmega showed off a system being trialed in four German vineyards that uses sensors to measure the temperature and humidity of the soil as well as of the air. The upshot? Grapes that are able to tell the farmer via a mobile app when it's time to pick them.

And Fujitsu demoed - or should that be demood? - an Internet-connected ankle monitor for cows that allows farmers to keep track of the movements and health of their herds and even predict milk yields.

For most business owners, however, it's the host of new ways to accept payments for goods and services that promises to make the biggest impact in coming years.

## More ways to pay

Samsung caused a stir at MWC with an announcement that its mobile payments service, [Samsung Pay][0], already has approximately five million registered users who have have spent more than $500 million (R7.8 billion) using the service since its release last September.

In the coming months, users can expect to see Samsung Pay spread from the US and South Korea to China, followed by Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Spain and the UK.

There's no word yet on when it'll reach South Africa.
Unlike rival services from Apple and Google, Samsung Pay, which comes loaded on the tech giant's newest smartphones, works with traditional card payment terminals as well as the latest ones that have Near Field Communication (NFC) chips.

This means it can be used at smaller shops with older terminals as well as big chains with cutting edge scanning technology.
Not to be outdone, credit card companies are rushing their own alternative payment solutions to market.

MasterCard has some of the most weird and wonderful ways to pay, including fitness bands, smart watches and, even, a smart ring.

The prize, if media buzz was anything to go by, goes to Selfie Pay, which, if it makes it out of beta testing, will let MasterCard clients pay for things by simply looking at their phones and blinking once.

The blink is designed to foil fraudsters trying to pay with a photo of someone or, worse - I'll leave that to your imagination!

Just how many of these technologies will arrive on SA shores in the near future is uncertain, but one this is clear - local consumers are eager for cheaper and quicker ways to pay.

Giving this ability to customers is obviously in the interest of business owners and the Internet of Things offers the enticing prospect of delivering this in increasingly innovative ways over the coming months and years.
