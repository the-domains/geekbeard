Occasionally running a full system scan is good, but ongoing scanning of downloads and web pages is essential.</p><p>These security programs will also frequently update their abilities and databases via downloads.</p><p>In addition, your browser probably has a number of options relating to secure browsing (check out the ‘Tools and Options’ tabs in the menus). Familiarise yourself with these and use settings you’re comfortable with.</p><p>Companies like Google house a plethora of information designed to help keep you safe when using your services - visit the <a href="http://www.google.co.za/safetycenter/">Google Safety Centre</a> for tips on keep your Gmail secure, for you and your family.</p><p>Creating secure passwords for all of your accounts - from your Gmail to your internet banking, is also critical. Create a unique password for each, and use a long string of numbers and letters to be absolutely sure your password isn’t easily hackable.</p><p>Alternatively use a phrase that only you know - for example, Mycathatesthevacuumcleaner and then intersperse the letters with numbers and special characters - Myc@th@t3t*v@c00mcl3@n3r, for example - to make it more secure.</p><p>Set up your password recovery options and keep them current by updating your secondary email address or cell number as required to make sure you can get into your account if you’re locked out.</p><p>Your service providers can use your phone number to challenge a login attempt they think is suspicious - for example if someone tries to log in from a machine that hasn’t logged into the service before, it will raise an alert and ask for a second round of validation to prove it’s you trying to get in.</p><p>Keeping an eye out for unsolicited emails and invitations is a good way to avoid phishing scams. Generally, these appear in the form of emails from institutions like banks, pretending to require some information from you. Best practise is to ignore these altogether.</p><blockquote><p>Your bank will NEVER ask you for personal information via email. Never click on links within these suspicious communications.</p><p></p></blockquote><p>If you suspect the email is legitimate, but aren't sure, call the sender and check rather than clicking anything. Most importantly, never EVER reveal any information about yourself, your family or your financial details.</p><p>If you have kids, be sure to discuss this with them, as well as what types of information to be careful about sharing with friends and strangers.</p><p>When a window pops up asking you to download an installed programme’s update, don’t ignore it. More than likely, part of that update fixes new vulnerabilities that have been discovered. This applies to most of the programs installed on your PC, including your browser and your operating system itself.</p><p> Setting up a Google Alert for your browser is an excellent idea. A Google Alert is a service that allows Google to send you an email alert every time a particular search phrase that you’ve entered is encountered by Google’s bots. </p><p>So, for example, if you use Chrome as a browser, set up a Google Alert for “Google Chrome Security”. If any security issues arise relating to Chrome, you’ll receive an email in fairly short shrift.</p><p>If you use a number of sites or social media accounts that require passwords or logins, make sure those passwords are different for each of those accounts. Better to keep a list of those passwords written down somewhere safe, than to use the same password for all your accounts.</p><p>When sites are asking for passwords for you to log in, make sure the URL reads Https://. The “s” indicates that the site uses encryption, making it more secure.</p><p> Be very careful of using public or free wi-fi services. In fact, if you can avoid them, at all, even better. Virtual Private Networks – both paid and privately set up – are also an option, and are preferred by many advanced web users.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Safe browsing tips</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
